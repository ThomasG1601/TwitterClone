TwitterClone

Why
I created this TwitterClone because of a project in HTML class.

What
My TwitterClone is a clone of the Twitter website.
The TwitterClone let the user navigate between tweets, people, and topic. I used HTML5 and CSS3 throught Visual Studio Code.
For me, it was difficult to put responsive in.
This project solves the problem of the responsive, of the scroll and the hover.
I learn to build an HTML project, to manage my time and to order my code.
