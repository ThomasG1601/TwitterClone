TwitterClone
My TwitterClone is a clone of the Twitter website.
The TwitterClone let the user navigate between tweets, people and topic. I used HTML5 and CSS3 throught Visual Studio Code.
For me, it was difficult to put responsive in.

I created this TwitterClone because of a project in HTML class.
This project solve the problem of the responsive, of the scroll and the hover.
I learn to build an HTML project, to manage my time and to order my code.

WARNING !!
It is not a functionnal website as the official Twitter.
